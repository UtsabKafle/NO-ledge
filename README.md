# NO-ledge

a script that takes random topics from wikipedia, pulls 5 new of them daily(if connected to internet), Converts the content to an image, shows the image and says/speak/read the content in it.


Planning to create an executable and adding it to the startup folder, So that whenever I start my device, some bullshitty picture will appear and talk my device starts talking shit.
